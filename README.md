# GOES 16 Tools

Placeholder for now while being developed. Will be a tool suite which wraps the AWS S3 SDK and uses a few other packages to search and download GOES data locally to a folder called "s3" which will be created in the same location as this package.


## Install

To install just run ```nmp install``` from a command prompt or terminal in this directory.

```
cd thisDirectory
npm installing
```
